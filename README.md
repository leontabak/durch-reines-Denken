This is an application to introduce students to the German language
and German contributions 
to science and mathematics.

At the outset of this project, we are thinking about an application
for the Web that will include
- quotations by German-speaking scientists
- quotations by German-speaking mathematicians
- quotations by German-speaking engineers
- brief, humorous German stories
- photographs
- a timeline of scientific discoveries
